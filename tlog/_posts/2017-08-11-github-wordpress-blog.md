title: "GitHub versus WordPress for blogging"
---

I have been [blogging with WordPress](http://blog.liyiwei.org/) for a while, and started experimenting with GitHub here.

GitHub allows explicit control of all files via git and is fun to use, for programmers at least.
However, WordPress offers more functionality with friendlier interface for general users.
I also built my homepage via dynamic php code for full style control, which is suitable for neither GitHub nor WordPress.
