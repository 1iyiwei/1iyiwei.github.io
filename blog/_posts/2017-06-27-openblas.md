While running some LSTM experiments in Keras the code ran into memory leak, which turned out to be an issue of Theano and BLAS hook up.
<a href = "https://github.com/1iyiwei/pyml/blob/master/code/ch13/install.md#openblas">Here</a> is the solution I found.

In case you don't want the default BLAS with Theano (due to various reasons such as [memory leak](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/5935) or [speed](http://ankivil.com/making-theano-faster-with-cudnn-and-cnmem-on-windows-10/)), you can install OpenBLAS as an alternative.

Below is a summary from [here](http://ankivil.com/making-theano-faster-with-cudnn-and-cnmem-on-windows-10/) for Windows:

* Download [mingw64_dll.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openblas/files/v0.2.14/mingw64_dll.zip/download).

* Download [OpenBLAS-v0.2.14-Win64-int32.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openblas/files/v0.2.14/OpenBLAS-v0.2.14-Win64-int32.zip/download).

* Create a directory to put OpenBLAS, `C:\openblas` for instance.

* Copy the DLLs from `mingw64_dll` and `OpenBlas/bin` into `C:\openblas`.

* Add to following lines to your `.theanorc` file:
```
    [blas]
    ldflags = -LC:\openblas -lopenblas
``` 

* Add `C:\OpenBlas` to the `PATH` environment variable.

* Run check_blas.py for verification:
```
    import os, theano

    total_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(theano.__file__), "misc", "check_blas.py")

    os.system("python " + total_path)
```

If there is a more principled way to do this (e.g., via conda or pip install), please let me know.
